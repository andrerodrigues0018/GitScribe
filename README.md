## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **extension**: This directory organizes all files related to the Chrome extension that will be published on the Chrome Web Store.
- **frontend**: This directory contains the web application that is rendered inside the extension through an iframe.

### Using the Extension in Chrome or Edge

1. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page:
   - For Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - For Edge: Go to `edge://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (usually found in the top-right corner of the page).
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` folder from this project.
4. The extension will now be loaded and available for use.
